# JSON:API Parser

Utilities for parsing responses in the JSON:API format. JSON:API gives a standard for the structure of API responses such that there are 'data' keys with an array of JSON objects possibly containing 'attributes' and 'relationships' keys.

Manually extracting data from such responses is cumbersome, the hope is this makes it simpler.

See the [JSON:API specification](https://jsonapi.org/).
